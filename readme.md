Every evening, we want to relax at home in the comfort of our own home. And sometimes, that relaxation can't be complete without a cold drink. A highball is the perfect choice for such moments. However, making a highball with the right proportions is harder than it sounds, so I decided to develop an AI highball machine - a personal bartender for your home.

#### Project Background

The appeal of a highball lies in its simplicity and sophisticated flavor. However, achieving the perfect blend of this simple drink requires precise proportions and skill, so I decided to automate this process using a Wiznet Pico POE and a water pump. The idea is simple: use AI to calculate the correct proportions and a water pump to mix the whiskey and soda water in the correct ratio.
